## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please see our [Developer Documentation](DEVELOPER_DOCS.md) for detailed development guidelines.

### Development Notes
- **UI Architecture**: Main UI consolidated in `ContentView.swift` due to Xcode build target limitations
- **Method Detection**: Use centralized `Recipe` static methods for consistency
- **File Creation**: Avoid creating new Swift files - they're difficult to add to Xcode project targets
- **Testing**: Maintain the stable test suite when making changes
