## Core Data Implementation

### PersistenceController
Singleton controller managing Core Data stack with preview support.

- Automatic change merging from parent context
- Error handling with comprehensive logging
- Sample data generation for previews

**CRUD Operations:**
- `createCoffee()` - Coffee creation with validation
- `createRecipe()` - Recipe creation with method-specific handling
- `createBrewingNote()` - Brewing session creation with usage tracking
- `deleteCoffee()`, `deleteRecipe()`, `deleteBrewingNote()` - Safe deletion

### Data Validation
