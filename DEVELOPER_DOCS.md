**Important**: Due to Xcode build target issues, all main UI functionality has been consolidated into `ContentView.swift`. The individual view files in the `Views/` folder exist but are not included in the build target. Only `SimpleCoffeeListView.swift` remains active and is referenced from `ContentView.swift`.
