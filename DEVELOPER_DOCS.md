**Important**: Due to Xcode build target issues, all main UI functionality has been consolidated into `ContentView.swift`. The individual view files in the `Views/` folder exist but are not included in the build target. Only `SimpleCoffeeListView.swift` remains active and is referenced from `ContentView.swift`.

- Graceful degradation when required data is missing

**Edge Case Testing:**
- Zero and negative rating handling in brewing notes
- Empty string and nil date handling across all entities
- Invalid brewing method detection and fallback behavior
- Relationship integrity with orphaned entities

**Search Edge Cases:**
